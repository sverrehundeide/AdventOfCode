This piece of code is not the most terse or efficient solution to this problem, but it shows how a bi-directional, circular linked list can be used to model the digits which the dial points at. 

The circular linked list should be easy reason about since it closesly resembles the physical dial described in the problem statement.

It should also be easy to extend the functionality if more requirements are added, like for example showing a visual representation of the dials movement ant position.
